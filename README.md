# Mini-Metro

This application is a shortcut dock to popular applications and websites. It also has an expanded view that contains several other widget apps written for this dock. It includes widgets like
        * Clock widget (Analog and Digital)
        * Notes taker
        * Desktop search
        * Integrated multi-purpose search that integrates the searching power of Google, Windows Desktop, Wikipedia and browsers with dynamic suggestion list.
        * Calender widget
        * Several Games (whose code also I have published in Github)
        * The search widget uses a custom Search query builder built specifically for this application
        * This also has a voice assistant of Microsoft customized for this application

This is developed using C# and XAML
